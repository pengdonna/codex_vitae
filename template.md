This Codex Vitae, or “book of life”, is a collection of my beliefs and concepts that inform my decisions and life. It is a work in constant flux; as my understanding changes, so will my beliefs. The main purpose of this document is to
1. pull my beliefs into the light where I can questions them more effectively and
2. to share philosophies, concepts, tools, and inspiration that have been helpful to me.

*It's about making things explicit.*

<h1> Instructions </h1>

If you **_are_** Donna:

* Develop a habit of using the Codex as a repository for beliefs that develop throughout the year.
* Consider doing a monthly review of whether my life is in alignment with values and beliefs. If not, should my behavior change or have my understanding and values changed?
* Do a yearly review in January of the entire document, editing places where beliefs have changed. Expect beliefs and tactics to change — don’t hold on to them too rigidly.


If you **_are not_** Donna

* Read this with the understanding that you are different than Donna — the way she lives her life is not the way you should live yours.
* Consider creating your own Codex Vitae. Feel free to copy anything here that is helpful.

<h1>Meta-beliefs</h1>
Beliefs about beliefs, including where they originate and the applicaiton of these beliefs.


1. My existing beliefs are mental models that, for me, sufficiently explain my perceived experiences
* A belief is a mental model of causality
* Humans have bounded rationality, thus we construct partial workable mental maps of reality
* All beliefs are wrong, but some are useful


2. Evolution of my consciousness means being able to take more persepectives, embodying higher differentation (increasing depth) and higher integration (wider range)
* Consciousness is the **continuous** stream of interpreted reality
* The overall trend of evolution is increasing differentiation and integration
* The evolution of my consciousness is a fractal representation of the universe to which I belong

3. Previous beliefs that have served me well are most likely to become the constraints for the next stage of my conscious evolution

4. My beliefs are inviting change through new experiences and new perception/interpretation of previous experiences
* Updating beliefs require having at least a rough inventory of existing beliefs
* New experiences and perceptions/interpretation can be accidental (always exposing myself to some random events/influences), but they can also come from intentional experiments: testing a belief by putting it to practice
* The Codex Vitae is my tool for advancing these goals

5. I am aware that I adopt new beliefs/update olde beliefs on the following grounds
* Congruence with external knowledge base and previous experiences: stability vs. stagnation
* Demonstration of concern and care for myself and others: rights vs. responsibilities
* Reflection of the beauty of transient existence in a timeless universe: subjective vs. objective

Aside: The Codex Vitae probably appeals most to those, like me, have a meta-belief which endorses continuously updating one's beliefs.
The application this meta-belief is what I would call a meta-skill (See Ribbonfarm [post](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/06/16/meta-skills-macro-laws-and-the-power-of-constraints/) on meta-skills).

The categories for beliefs that I have decised are rougly based on the AQAL framework from [integral theory](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Integral_theory_(Ken_Wilber))
* The category *On self care and own actions* corresponds to the individual end of the framework
* The category *On material and spiritual environment* corresponds to the collective end of the framework
* The category *At the confluence*, as its name indicates, addresses issues that straddle these arbitrary divisions


<h1>On self care and own actions</h1>

<h2> Food </h2
* Factory farming causes a large amount of animal suffering, thus a largely vegetable-based diet is more aligned with my values
* Hallucinogens can induce temporary altered states of consciousness which are desirable, but they cannot be relied on to remain in such states indefinitely
* Sometimes I eat because I am bored and/or stressed, to identify those occasions I can apply the apple test

<h2> Physical Fitness </h2>
* Functional fitness is more important than apperarance
* However, insecurity over appearance can be a major obstacle to connecting with others/oneself

<h2> Family </h2>
* Independence from one's family of origin is necessary before re-integration into it
* *Ideal* family relationships are narrated by cultures, individual families need to define their own


<h2> Friendship </h2>
* I most enjoy meeting people in structured group activities and one-on-one conversations
* I am unsure whether to and how to maintain friendships that no longer benefit from proximity, repeated unplanned interactions
* Theoretically, I enjoy the company of others, but in practice it often takes more energy than I can muster

<h1> On material and spiritual environment </h1>

<h2> Self-expression </h2>
* The purpose of art, for me, is to meaningfully express myself and engage with the expression of others
* Reading and writing have been my primary means, I would like to refine them and develop other vehicles, especially those embodied in the actions of daily life
 * Dressing
 * Preparation of food
 * Arrangement of space
* Unable to create, we fall prey to consumerism and purchase the ready-made equivalent of self-expression
* I see living my own life as the ultimate mean of self expression

<h2> Money </h2>
* Money is an important mean to remove constraints (especially on time) but not an end
* Being wealthy is not a sin (strong wording...) but human nature (evolutionary morality) abhores inequality


<h2> Work </h2>
* Being paid for my work is not the only but an important external validation of the value I contribute
* However, I need to be mindful of the role of the value that I contribute
  * Am I really creating new value or helping rent-seekig behaviour?
  * How is the value created distributed?
* Work life balance is a problematic concept, at least on a daily basis
 * It is true that some form of boundary between around work is necessary to prevent it from becoming all encompassing (especially for me)
 * The nature of my current work means irregular intensity, which I need to adapt to


<h2> Community </h2>
* I find participating in/building a community an energy consuming affair, therefore I only consider these activities when I have surplus energy, which rarely happens


<h1> At the confluence </h1>

<h2> Intimacy </h2>
* Sharing of vulnerabilities is necessary but insufficient for building intimate relationships
* Early [crystallisation] (https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/11/29/stendhal-on-love-crystallization/) in a relationship prevents us from seeing the partner as they truly are, a type of *mauvaise foi*
* Attraction: balance of the familiar and the unknown

<h2> Purpose and transcendence </h2>
* Purposes are a special type of belief that anchors the self-narrative, helpful construct but beware when it gets out of hand
 * A person always come before an idea
* Personality theory and astrology are frameworks that attempt to describe different archetypes of self-narrativies
 * The most personal is the most universal


<h2> Impact </h2>
* The impact of our actions is almost never the ones that we have planned
* It is futile and a waste of energy to worry about the realm over which we have no control

<h2> Learning </h2>
* Learning can occur within the same decision-making rule set or on the rule set
  * Single loop learning does not quesetion method or goal
  * Double loop learning may involve changing the problem statement
* In the process of learning we deconstruct the assumptions which have assissted us thus far, the whole thing is comparable to bootstrapping
 * ![Throughput of learning](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/rf5.002-1024x576.jpeg)
* There is a difference between intellectual understanding and embodied understanding
  * Life is a succession of lessons which must be lived to be understood

<h2> Concepts </h2>
** Unconditional positive regard **
A concept developed by the humanistic psychologist Carl Rogers, is the basic acceptance and support of a person regardless of what the person says or does, especially in the context of client-centered therapy.[1] Its founder, Carl Rogers, writes:

> The central hypothesis of this approach can be briefly stated. It is that the individual has within him or her >self vast resources for self-understanding, for altering her or his self-concept, attitudes, and self-directed behavior—and that these resources can be tapped if only a definable climate of facilitative psychological attitudes can be provided.[2]
