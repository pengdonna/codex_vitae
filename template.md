This Codex Vitae, or “book of life”, is a collection of my beliefs and concepts that inform my decisions and life. It is a work in constant flux; as my understanding changes, so will my beliefs. The main purpose of this document is to 
1. pull my beliefs into the light where I can questions them more effectively and 
2. to share philosophies, concepts, tools, and inspiration that have been helpful to me.

*It's about making things explicit.*

<h1> Instructions </h1>

If you **_are_** Donna:

* Develop a habit of using the Codex as a repository for beliefs that develop throughout the year.
* Consider doing a monthly review of whether my life is in alignment with values and beliefs. If not, should my behavior change or have my understanding and values changed?
* Do a yearly review in January of the entire document, editing places where beliefs have changed. Expect beliefs and tactics to change — don’t hold on to them too rigidly.


If you **_are not_** Donna

* Read this with the understanding that you are different than Donna — the way she lives her life is not the way you should live yours.
* Consider creating your own Codex Vitae. Feel free to copy anything here that is helpful.

<h1>Meta-beliefs</h1>
Beliefs about beliefs, including where they originate and the applicaiton of these beliefs.


1. My existing beliefs are mental models that, for me, sufficiently explain my perceived experiences
* A belief is a mental model of causality
* Humans have bounded rationality, thus we construct partial workable mental maps of reality
* All beliefs are wrong, but some are useful


2. Evolution of my consciousness means being able to take more persepectives, embodying higher differentation (increasing depth) and higher integration (wider range)
* Consciousness is the **continuous** stream of interpreted reality
* The overall trend of evolution is increasing differentiation and integration
* The evolution of my consciousness is a fractal representation of the universe to which I belong

3. Previous beliefs that have served me well are most likely to become the constraints for the next stage of my conscious evolution

4. My beliefs are inviting change through new experiences and new perception/interpretation of previous experiences
* Updating beliefs require having at least a rough inventory of existing beliefs
* New experiences and perceptions/interpretation can be accidental (always exposing myself to some random events/influences), but they can also come from intentional experiments: testing a belief by putting it to practice
* The Codex Vitae is my tool for advancing these goals

5. I am aware that I adopt new beliefs/update olde beliefs on the following grounds
* Congruence with external knowledge base and previous experiences: stability vs. stagnation
* Demonstration of concern and care for myself and others: rights vs. responsibilities
* Reflection of the beauty of transient existence in a timeless universe: subjective vs. objective

Aside: The Codex Vitae probably appeals most to those, like me, have a meta-belief which endorses continuously updating one's beliefs. 
The application this meta-belief is what I would call a meta-skill (See Ribbonfarm [post](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/06/16/meta-skills-macro-laws-and-the-power-of-constraints/) on meta-skills). 

The categories for beliefs that I have decised are rougly based on the AQAL framework from [integral theory](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Integral_theory_(Ken_Wilber))
* The category *On self care and own actions* corresponds to the individual end of the framework
* The category *On material and spiritual environment* corresponds to the collective end of the framework
* The category *At the confluence*, as its name indicates, addresses issues that straddle these arbitrary divisions
