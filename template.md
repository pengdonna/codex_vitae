This Codex Vitae, or “book of life”, is a collection of my beliefs and concepts that inform my decisions and life. It is a work in constant flux; as my understanding changes, so will my beliefs. The main purpose of this document is to (1) pull my beliefs into the light where I can questions them more effectively and (2) to share philosophies, concepts, tools, and inspiration that have been helpful to me.

*It's about making things explicit.*

<h1> How to Use This Codex </h1>

If you **_are_** Donna:

* Develop a habit of using the Codex as a repository for beliefs that develop throughout the year.
* Consider doing a monthly review of whether my life is in alignment with values and beliefs. If not, should my behavior change or have my understanding and values changed?
* Do a yearly review in January of the entire document, editing places where beliefs have changed. Expect beliefs and tactics to change — don’t hold on to them too rigidly.


If you **_are not_** Donna

* Read this with the understanding that you are different than Donna — the way she lives her life is not the way you should live yours.
* Consider creating your own Codex Vitae. Feel free to copy anything here that is helpful.
